# Object Detection with YOLOv3

## Overview
This project implements an Object Detection system using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) algorithm. YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection model that is fast and accurate for detecting multiple objects in images and videos.

## Features
- Real-time object detection
- Detects multiple object classes (customizable)
- Provides bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects
- Easy to set up and run

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the project:

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Darknet (or pre-trained YOLOv3 weights)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov3-object-detection.git
   cd yolov3-object-detection
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv3 weights:
   - Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights from [YOLO Website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
   - Place the `yolov3.weights` file in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the object detection on an image:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

2. Run the object detection on a video:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --video /path/to/video.mp4
   ```

3. To use a custom model, specify the custom configuration file and weights:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image /path/to/image.jpg --config /path/to/custom_config.cfg --weights /path/to/custom_weights.weights
   ```

## How it works
1. **Loading the model**: YOLOv3 weights are loaded into the model using the Darknet framework or Keras/TensorFlow equivalents.
2. **Image/Video Input**: Input image or video is passed to the model for object detection.
3. **Detection**: The model predicts bounding boxes and object class labels in the input.
4. **Output**: The results are visualized with bounding boxes and class labels drawn on the input image or video.



## Customization
- **Changing Classes**: To detect custom objects, train the model on your dataset and adjust the class labels accordingly in the `class.names` file.
- **Model Training**: If you'd like to train YOLOv3 on your own dataset, refer to the training section in the [YOLOv3 documentation](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
